# 🌦️ Weather Temperature Prediction using Linear Regression

> Predict maximum and minimum temperatures using key weather features like current temperature and dew point.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict the **maximum and minimum temperatures** based on weather conditions. It uses **temperature** and **dew point** as input features and returns highly accurate predictions for `maxtemp` and `mintemp`.

✅ Built entirely in **Jupyter Notebook**  
✅ Uses **StandardScaler** for feature normalization  
✅ Achieved **R² score of 0.98+** — strong model fit  
✅ Built-in prediction script using user input  
✅ Simple, clean visualization with seaborn

## 📊 Sample Output

Enter temperature: 30
Enter dewpoint: 21

Predicted Max Temperature: 34.12 °C
Predicted Min Temperature: 26.54 °C

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Multi-output regression**: Predicts both `maxtemp` and `mintemp` simultaneously  
- 📉 **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** ~0.11  
- 🔍 **Visual EDA** using seaborn pair plots  
- 💻 User-interactive prediction within notebook (no web app needed)  
- ⚙️ Uses `StandardScaler` for accurate model learning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
